"States" is a game centered around territorial acquisition, where your primary objective is to conquer all territories available. These territories fall into three categories: 'Yours,' 'Not Claimed' (which can be acquired freely), and 'Claimed by Others.' To capture the latter, your budget must exceed 50. Acquiring such territories necessitates the possession of a 'Ministry of Defence,' a prerequisite even for entering the territories of others. Boosting your budget demands a robust economy. This can be achieved by constructing houses to accommodate people, establishing factories for lower-skilled jobs, and founding schools for higher-skilled professions. Striking the right balance among these aspects will yield optimal economic growth. The establishment of schools mandates the existence of a 'Ministry of Education,' while both the 'Ministry of Education' and 'Ministry of Defence' necessitate the prior construction of a 'Parliament.' Additionally, the game features roads that persist even after being occupied.
